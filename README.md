## Contributing
- We generated voice from the EEG of imagined speech. The fundamental constraint of the imagined speech-based BTS system lacking the ground truth voice have been addressed with generalized EEG of spoken speech to link the imagined speech EEG, spoken speech EEG, and the spoken speech audio.

- We propose a generative model based on multi-receptive residual modules with recurrent neural networks that can extract frequency characteristics and sequential information from neural signals, to enhance the generation of mel-spectrogram of the user's own voice from non-invasive brain signals.

- Character loss was utilized to a large extent to adapt various phonemes from the small amount of data. Therefore, unseen words of the imagined speech were able to be reconstructed from the pre-trained model. This implies that our model trained the character level information from the brain signal, which displays the potential of phoneme prediction using a small dataset of few words or phrases.
